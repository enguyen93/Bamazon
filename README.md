## Bamazon
An Amazon-like storefront using MySQL

When the application is run, using "node bamazonCustomer.js", the user will be shown the store's inventory. 
Then, using inquirer, the user will be prompted to
make a choice on which item they want to make a purchase of, and they will be required to enter an amount.

If the item is not available, it will tell them to choose again until a valid item is chosen, if the amount is not available it will
tell the user to lower their amount.
